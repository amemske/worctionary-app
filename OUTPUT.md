## Design Changes Made

### App.tsx - Main Component

1. **Background Color Update (Line 121)**

    - Fix: Updated to use `w-5 and h-5`

14. **Header Search Input Background Color**
    - Issue: Header search input background was using the default background color

    - Issue: Header search input width was 207px
    - Fix: Updated to 160px (`w-[160px]`) to match the design

16. **Header Border Color**
    - Issue: Header border was using the default gray-800 color
    - Fix: Updated `.border-gray-800` to use #9EABB8 for a lighter, muted border as per the design

17. **Header Search Icon Vertical Alignment**
    - Issue: Icon was positioned with top-2.5, making it too low
    - Fix: Updated to top-[5px] for more precise alignment

18. **Header Avatar Image Update**
    - Issue: Header avatar was using a generic `/avatar.jpg`
    - Fix: Updated to use `/task1/avatar_placeholder.png` for consistency with the design

19. **Hero Section H1 Letter Spacing**
    - Issue: The main heading in the hero section had default letter spacing
    - Fix: Added tracking-[-3px] to match the design's -3px letter spacing

20. **Hero Component Refactor**
    - Issue: The hero section (BoxArea97) was defined inline in App.tsx, making it less reusable and maintainable
    - Fix: Extracted and renamed BoxArea97 to a new Hero component in src/components/Hero.tsx, and updated App.tsx to use <Hero />

21. **Header and TagList Component Extraction**
    - Issue: Header and TagList were defined inline in App.tsx, reducing reusability and maintainability
    - Fix: Extracted Header and TagList into their own files in src/components/ and updated App.tsx to use them

22. **App.tsx Cleanup**
    - Issue: App.tsx contained unused BoxArea108 function and related imports after component extraction
    - Fix: Removed unused code to clean up the main App component

23. **Hero Section Padding Update**
    - Issue: Hero content overlay had minimal horizontal padding (px-4)
    - Fix: Increased to px-24 (96px) for better visual balance and breathing room

24. **Hero Search Button Color System**
    - Issue: Search button was using hardcoded blue colors (bg-blue-600, hover:bg-blue-700)
    - Fix: Updated to use bg-primary and hover:bg-primary/90 for design system consistency

25. **Primary Color Update**
    - Issue: Primary color was not set to the correct design color #1A80E5
    - Fix: Updated --primary CSS variable to use #1A80E5 for the design system

26. **Search Container Color System**
    - Issue: Search container was using bg-background instead of the correct design colors
    - Fix: Added --search-bg: #1C2126 and --search-border: #3D4754 CSS variables and updated the search container to use them

27. **Search Container Interactive Enhancement**
    - Issue: Only the input field was interactive, not the entire search container
    - Fix: Made entire container clickable and keyboard accessible with onClick, onKeyDown, role="button", tabIndex={0}, and cursor-pointer

28. **Search Container Focus States**
    - Issue: Container wasn't properly interactive and lacked visual feedback
    - Fix: Added focus:border-primary styling, prevented event bubbling on input, and added focus ring for better UX

29. **Search Container Amazon-Style Behavior**
    - Issue: Search container was overly complex with multiple click handlers
    - Fix: Simplified to work like Amazon search - input focus changes outer border color using group-focus-within, input has no border

30. **Search Container State-Based Border**
    - Issue: CSS focus states weren't working reliably for border color changes
    - Fix: Implemented state-based approach using isActive to change border color when input has content

31. **Hero Search Input Focus Styles**
    - Issue: Input component had built-in focus styles that couldn't be overridden with Tailwind classes
    - Fix: Added custom CSS class 'hero-search-input' with focus and focus-visible styles to completely remove all focus styling

32. **Search Container Focus State Fix**
    - Issue: Border color wasn't changing when input was focused due to removed focus styles
    - Fix: Added isFocused state and onFocus/onBlur handlers to ensure border changes work on focus

33. **Search Container Padding Adjustment**
    - Issue: Search container had too much horizontal padding (px-4)
    - Fix: Reduced horizontal padding to px-2 for tighter spacing

34. **Search Container Asymmetric Padding**
    - Issue: Search container had symmetric horizontal padding
    - Fix: Changed to asymmetric padding with pl-1 (4px left) and pr-0.5 (2px right)

35. **Header Search Focus Consistency**
    - Issue: Header search input didn't have focus state feedback like the hero search
    - Fix: Added focus state handling with blue ring feedback for consistency across search inputs

36. **Header Search Border Focus Fix**
    - Issue: Header search was using ring instead of border for focus state
    - Fix: Changed to use border-primary for consistency with hero search behavior

37. **Header Search Focus Styles Override**
    - Issue: Header search input had built-in focus-visible styles that needed to be removed
    - Fix: Added header-search-input CSS class with focus and focus-visible overrides to remove all default focus styling

39. **Header Search Border Visibility Fix**
    - Issue: CSS override was removing all borders, preventing border-primary from showing
    - Fix: Updated CSS to only remove focus ring and outline, allowing custom borders to display

40. **Header Search Direct Border Color**
    - Issue: Complex state-based border color wasn't working reliably
    - Fix: Added direct CSS rule `border-color: #1a80e5` for focus-visible state

41. **Header Search Input Functionality**
    - Issue: Header search input had hardcoded value "Search" preventing user typing
    - Fix: Added state management and placeholder to make the input functional and editable
